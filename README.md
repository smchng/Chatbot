This is a simple program made in python where it simulates you, a customer, ordering bubble tea at a boba shop. 
This program has no graphics or graphic interface. The interaction is done strictly through the run window. 
The program takes in your responses and proceeds depending on them. In the end, it totals up your order and asks for a payment.
